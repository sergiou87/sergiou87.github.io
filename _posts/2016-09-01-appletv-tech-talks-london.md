For those who're not aware, a couple of months ago [we](http://plex.tv) released our [Plex for Apple TV app](https://blog.plex.tv/2015/11/02/plex-on-the-new-apple-tv/). Since Apple announced this new device, we had to work really hard to get the app ready for the launch day. Luckily, we made it and [things seem to be going pretty well](http://www.imore.com/2015-imore-awards).

However, tvOS is still a young platform, with lots of new things to learn and bugs and limitations to work around. We are happy with the quality of our Apple TV app but still had to make some difficult decisions due to our lack of knowledge of the platform and some of these annoying (but understandable) bugs and limitations.

Thankfully, Apple invited me and a other two Plexians to the Apple TV Tech Talks in London this Monday, where we expect to learn a lot from Apple engineers and get some technical advice to improve the app as much as possible.

If you've been invited too, feel free to say hi to the guys with the [Plex hoodie/shirt](https://stores.kotisdesign.com/plex/apparel)!
