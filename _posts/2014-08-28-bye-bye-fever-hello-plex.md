It's been two months already since I left my position as *iOS Lead Engineer* at **Fever** and started working at [**Plex**](http://plex.tv) developing the iOS app.

I've learned lots of things developing the whole **Fever** app: both from the experience itself and from my colleagues' knowledge (**thank you** David, Saúl, Jorge, Viti, Eddie, Adri, Danny, Josu…).

This new phase at **Plex** will be very different: a completely American company building a product with all their employees working **remotely**, developing an app about audio/video streaming with lots of active users already loving the app, and a lots of new projects and ideas to implement with focus on **quality**.

Fortunately, I get to work with **awesome** people including some former co-workers at [Tuenti](http://www.tuenti.com) like [Luis Recuenco](https://github.com/luisrecuenco) and [Manuel Peinado](https://github.com/ManuelPeinado), so I've already learned a lot of stuff by just working here.

I'll try to share the new knowledge I get in this blog :)
