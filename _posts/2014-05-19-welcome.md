My name is [**Sergio Padrino**](http://github.com/sergiou87) and I'm the *iOS Lead Engineer* at **Fever**. I'm a former *iOS Software Engineer* at [**Tuenti**](http://www.tuenti.com), the Spanish social network and [MVNO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator).

During this series of blog posts I'll be writing about my work and thoughts as iOS developer, specially based on my experiences working at Fever and Tuenti. Here you will read some posts about our workflow, the app architecture, problems we found (and how we solved them), etc.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sergiou87/sergiou87.github.io/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/sergiou87).

Thanks for reading!
