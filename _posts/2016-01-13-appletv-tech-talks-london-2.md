Finally back in Madrid after the Apple TV Tech Talks in London. I really had a great time there meeting some friends but also lots of new people! We also had the chance to ask some questions to Apple engineers and get some help to improve our app.

Regarding the talks themselves, I liked them but they were too basic for my (current) knowledge, but I'm sure other people enjoyed them far more than me!

Anyway it's good to confirm that the hard time I had while developing the app wasn't (entirely) my fault, but mostly because of tvOS bugs (totally understandable).

Looking forward to the next event! (Whichever it is ðŸ˜†)
