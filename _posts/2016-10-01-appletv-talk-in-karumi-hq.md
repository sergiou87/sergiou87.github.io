Related to our work on the Plex for Apple TV app, I had the chance to give a talk to 30-40 people in the office of [Karumi](http://karumi.com/) (great persons, even better devs!!), which was recorded and published by [Autentia](http://autentia.com/).

In this talk, poorly named "Introduction to Apple TV development", I explain all the problems we faced and decisions we made to get the app ready for the Apple TV launch day, but unfortunately for non-Spanish speakers, I did it in my mother language ðŸ˜…

You can watch the entire talk with slides here: [IntroducciÃ³n al desarrollo en Apple TV - Sergio Padrino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVYcVzUmIn8)
